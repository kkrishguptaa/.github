# 🫂 Need help?

I believe that Open Source is an amazing thing to happen to mankind. I truly appreciate the community for helping me and teaching me a lot of things!

I'm happy to help you to contribute or use any of my projects 💖

I suggest using the following resources **before** seeking help:

- 📖 Read the documentation for the project
- 🔍 Search on Google if it is a generic issue (not related to the project)

If none of those work, reach out to me on the following platforms:

- **RECOMMENDED**: Join my [discord server](https://dub.sh/kultiverse-discord)
- Alternatively, you can also Tweet out to me: [@xkrishguptaa](https://twitter.com/xkrishguptaa)
