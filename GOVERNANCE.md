# üë®üèª‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Governance

Most of the repositories under my account are `NOT` huge libraries or projects that a lot of people work on.

> Important repository names that start with `learning` are where I push updates of my learnings, nothing is needed of contributions there! You can make issues for suggestions though.

## üß† Decision Making

- For the project discussions, they are made publicly, in the community. It is democratic, but the maintainer's views weigh a little bit more considering their contributions to the project.
- For private discussions, such as **moderation** actions or picking new maintainers, these discussions are kept private between the **maintainers**.
